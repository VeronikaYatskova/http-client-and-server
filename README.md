# Modeling client-server communication

Simple implementation of communication between client and server using HTTP protocol.

## Build with:

* C# console app
* [HttpClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=net-7.0) - a class for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses from a resource identified by a URI;
* [HttpListener](https://zetcode.com/csharp/httplistener/) - a simple, programmatically controlled HTTP protocol listener;
* [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) - library that provides diagnostic logging to files, the console, and elsewhere;
* [CommandLine](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) - command line parser.
